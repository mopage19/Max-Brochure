A 2\u201d x 4\u201d extrusion forms the main \u000d\u000abody, and machined stringer brackets bolt into the clamp system, providing an extremely secure, stable connection point for the dock sections to attach. \u000d\u000aUnlike the traditional cross arms clamps and optional stringer brackets that fail at a high rate. The Maxloc base is a machined 2\u2019 x 4\u201d extrusion that wont \u000d\u000asag or slip under heavy foot traffic, and easily out performs lesser supports.\u000d\u000aMaxStand stanchions were developed to provide a strong platform for Max Standard & Signature dock. The stands main extrusion is the proprietary MSE \u000d\u000aor MaxStand extrusion, this extrusion was originally intended to be just for MaxStands but you now can see it in other Max products for its strength and \u000d\u000aversatility. The stands MSE horizontal support beam legs are machined at a 7\u00b0 Angle to give a wider stance at the bottom with welded foot pads standard. \u000d\u000aThe wider platform stands 9\u2019 to 12\u2019 and up come with center legs kits that are bolted into the MSE. This creates one of the strongest stand alone dock \u000d\u000asupports on the market today. The adjustability of the stand makes it the number one replacement stand for older docks in the field.\u000d\u000aLochdock Leg Kits are mounted internally with inside the Lochdock referred to as LD2 Or Lochdock Plus PL frames. Some kits can be used on both docks \u000d\u000aand some are specific to each. If you read the descriptions you can see which ones those are, your Max dealer can also help you in making sure you have \u000d\u000athe correct ones for the dock layout you are making.
